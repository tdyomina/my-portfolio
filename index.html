      <p>
        Broken people get recycled And I hope that I will Sometimes we're thrown
        off our pathways What I thought was my way home Wasn't the place I know
        I'm not afraid of changing I'm certain nothing's certain What we own
        becomes our prison My possessions will be gone Back to where they came
        from Blame, no one is to blame As natural as the rain that falls Here
        comes the flood again See the rock that you hold onto Is it gonna save
        you When the earth begins to crumble? Why do you feel you have to hold
        on? Imagine if you let go Blame, no one is to blame As natural as the
        rain that falls Here comes the flood again Wash away the weight that
        pulls you down Ride the waves that free you from your doubts? Don't
        trust your eyes (wash) It's easy to believe them (away) Know in your
        heart (the weight) That you can leave your prison (pulls you down) Don't
        trust your mind (ride) It's not always listening (the waves) Turn on the
        lights (that free) And feel the ancient rhythm (from your doubts) Don't
        trust your eyes (blame) It's easy to believe them (no one is to blame)
        Know in your heart (as natural as the rain) That you can leave your
        prison (here comes the flood again) Blame, no one is to blame As natural
        as the rain that falls Here comes the flood again, ooh
